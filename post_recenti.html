<p>
Thugs in Paris <a target="_top" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/26/paris-police-filmed-beating-music-producer">attacked a man</a> who was walking to his office without a
mask, and beat him bloody. Then they made false accusations against
him.
<p>
Did they do this because he did not wear a mask? Or did they do this
because he was black? I suppose it was the latter, since they called
him racist insults too.
<p>
It was right for them to take quick action on seeing a person outside
without a mask on. But the proper action was to give him a mask to
put on immediately, and fine him. Perhaps arrest him if it was a
repeat offense. Not to invade his studio and attack him and others.
<p>

I am optimistic too. The US has done many unjust things to Iran,

Then there was supporting Iraq in invading Iran in the 1980s,
and grueling sanctions in this century.
<p>
Iran has done some nasty things to the US, such as taking hostages in

all in all Iran has suffered more in this exchange than the US.

I am sure people can think of more effective regulatory systems.
The reason they are not in place in the UK is that the government

<p>
But I have two other recommendations that may shock the people
who expect that business will always be above human beings.
<ul>
 <li>
 Place criminal charges against the individuals who made these
 dangerous decisions that resulted in deaths. That will teach
 people not to expect to they can get away with this.
 How about 72 charges of homicide for each one?
 </li>
 <li>
 Prohibit companies from being owned by anything like a private equity
 fund. Give those funds a deadline to liquidate their assets and return
 the funds to the investors; on that date, seize whatever property they
 still own. In the interim, don't allow funds to take any profit out of
 these companies; that profit should stay in the individual company
 until it is sold. The buyer will therefore pay for that profit, but
 this will eliminate the fund's incentive to drain the company dry
 before selling it.
